## 🌟 Overview

**Floating Player** is a modern, lightweight Windows desktop application built with **WinForms** and **WebView2**, allowing you to browse and multitask effortlessly. Watch YouTube, use ChatGPT, open WhatsApp or LinkedIn — all while working on other applications. The app stays **always on top**, so you never lose focus.

## ❓ Why I Created This App

I built **Floating Player** to solve a personal pain point — there was **no official app that allowed floating, always-on-top browser tabs** for websites like YouTube or ChatGPT. Existing browsers didn’t offer a smooth or native solution.
So, I created this app to fulfill my own need for **a multitasking-friendly floating browser**, and now I’m sharing it with others who might find it just as useful.
